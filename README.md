•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  o	I can ensure that my code is functional by writing tests that verify the individual components, as well as tests that ensure the     components work together cohesively. Another way to make sure there aren’t errors throughout the code is to use the interpreter’s      highlighting features. Sometimes the messages are unnecessary, but there are times when they’ve helped me find bugs. 


•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  o	User needs are obtained early in the software development process and need to be incorporated into the design of the program. I     like to look at things from as zoomed out as I can to see if anything is a glaring issue or if the overall program is steering in the   direction that the user wants. 


•	How do I approach designing software?

  o I approach software design like a system that is made up of smaller systems, like the human body. The skeletal and muscular system   shape the body, but each limb has a complex system itself, and all the parts move in tandem to accomplish shared goals.
